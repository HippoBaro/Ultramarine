## Introduction

Ultramarine is a modern C++ framework to write distributed applications using virtual actors. It allows developers to write highly scalable applications while greatly simplifying discovery, state management, actor lifetime and more.

It is heavily inspired by the [Microsoft Orleans](https://dotnet.github.io/orleans/Documentation/index.html) project.
